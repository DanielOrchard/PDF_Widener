# PDF Note Expander

## Overview
PDF Note Expander is a simple Python-based GUI tool designed to help enhance your study or note-taking process. It allows you to drop a PDF onto the application, and then it widens each page by a specified amount. This added space can be left blank or filled with lines, providing a convenient area to jot down notes when using note-taking apps like Notability on an iPad.

Originally created to support my own university studies, this tool is tailored to my specific needs. It's made available for anyone who finds it useful, with no intention of broad-scale deployment or commercial use.

## Features
- **PDF Modification:** Easily widen your PDFs to create space for notes.
- **Customizable Padding:** Choose between blank space or lined padding on the right side of each page.
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** A user-friendly GUI that simplifies your workflow.
